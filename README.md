## 🧩 How It Works

PrivacyPal activates automatically when you visit a website:
1. It **analyzes the site** for known tracker patterns, HTTPS status, and cookies.
2. If privacy risks are detected, a **popup alert** appears with recommendations.
3. After a few seconds, it hides quietly — unless suspicious activity is detected again.
